data:
  status: Needs SDMX conversion
metadata:
  status: Needs machine readable version

sdglab:
  country: 8

sdmx:
  - no sdmx, but lack of disaggregation means it would not be too hard

issues:
  - not obvious how to get to the data from the published URL (http://dosweb.dos.gov.jo/sdgs/)
  - lack of disaggregation (sub-indicator and governorate are examples)
  - X axis labels incorrect when sorted
  - json download did not have years
  - difficult to see disaggregation on charts (shades of blue)
  - too many clicks to get to data
