Moreover, a reference period is usually required in order to characterize the use of a specific area of agricultural land and identify subcategories.</p><p>In particular, following the WCA 2020, agricultural land includes: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 land under temporary crops\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 land under temporary meadows and pastures \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 land temporarily fallow \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 land under permanent crops \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 land under permanent meadows and pastures</p><p><strong>Agricultural population:</strong> Indicator 5.a.1 uses \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcagricultural population\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as denominator, instead of the total population, because tenure rights over agricultural land are relevant especially for individuals whose livelihood relies on agriculture. As a consequence, in the context of 5.a.1, the term \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcagricultural population\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has to be interpreted as equivalent of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindividuals engaged in agriculture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.</p><p><strong>Ownership and tenure rights over agricultural land:</strong> Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to a freehold tenure. However, in systems where land is owned by the State, the term \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcland ownership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system. In this context, it is more appropriate to speak of tenure rights. </p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percent (%)</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>3 years</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Integrated Household Living Condition (EICV), agriculture housesold survey</p>","COVERAGE":"<h2>Geographical coverage</h2><p>National</p>","COMPARABILITY":"<h2>Indicator available</h2><p>Percentage (%) of households owning agricultural land in the past 12 months by sex of head of household</p><h2>Link to UN Metadata</h2><p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)</a></p>","OTHER_DOC":"<h2>UN designated tier</h2><p>2</p>","indicator":"5.a.1","target_id":"5.a","sdg_goal":"5","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"05-0a-01","indicator_name":"(a) Proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners or rights-bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure","graph_title":"(a) Proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners or rights-bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure"}
