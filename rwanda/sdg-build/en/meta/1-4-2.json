An individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, or collectively as member of group1, cooperative or other type of association.

Although those without land rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are insufficient to guarantee tenure security.
